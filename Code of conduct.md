# Code of Conduct

We have some rules to help keep our community a safe, nice and inclusive place to be. If you are a nice person and you are truly acting in good faith, it should basically be impossible to break them.

## Rules for everyone

Everyone should follow these rules:

1. **Hate speech and descrimination are not allowed.**<br/>Among other issues, hate and descrimiation makes people feel uncomfortable being themselves, and discrimination explicit prevents it, leading to things as extreme as murder and war crimes. As such, you may not, at any time, express hatred or discrimation towards people based on ethnicity, race, religion, sexuality, gender or transgender status, species or transpecies status, appearance, fincnical status, nationality, body size or weight, personal intrests or any other classification would be considered unfair. We will, within reason, consider behaviour outside of the Shatter Team.

2. **Please always do good things.**<br/>Generally, you should always act in good faith. Do not do anything with the intent to hurt, harm or otherwise cause unneeded conflict with someone else.

## Banning

Bans and ban lengths are up to the staff and trusted community members to decide.
